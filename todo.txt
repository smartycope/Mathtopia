f(x) = sqrt(x), x=x, eq=-1: causes eq box to think x is specified (disables itself)
find the domain and range of the function
a box where you specify an interval, and it tells you if the function is constant, increasing, decreasing, positive, negative, or nonnegative across that interval
     if the DERIVATIVE of a function is positive on an interval, then the function is increasing on that interval. If the DERIVATIVE of a function is negative on an interval, then the function is decreasing on that interval.
