order variables better
slope equation
master solve?
units?
find the domain and range of the function
add assumtions to variables you specify https://docs.sympy.org/latest/guides/assumptions.html
move SS to Cope
custom code printing doesn't work
The ! in !Errors is delayed
log(x, 12) often doesn't work when solving, but log(x)/log(12) does. Auto Parse?
min and max are kind of annoying and not that useful. have only as a custom function?
are the interval boxes backwards?
log2(xâˆ’5)+log2(x+10)=4 doens't set the eq box properly? -- I think it's failing when it just came from being disabled
it doesn't plot if there's multiple vars in a var box (tuple)
add limiting the graph to the provided interval
if they specify variables manually, plot them on a scatter plot
annotations on the graph
